# Aleksandar Zeljic's Homepage

I am a computer scientist and I hold a PhD from Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University. My research focused on SMT-style reasoning about machine arithmetic (floating-point and bit-vector arithmetics). I was supervised by Philipp Ruemmer, Christoph M. Wintersteiger and Wang Yi. You can find my CV here.

### Research
My research interests include the following:

* Automated reasoning (SAT, SMT, Theorem proving)
* Formal verification and testing
* Machine learning

Projects:
  - UppSAT - implements an approximation-based framework for SMT solvers.
  - mcBV - a model-constructing SMT solver for the theory of quantifier-free fixed-size bit-vectors.
  - SmallFloats - prototype implementation of the approximation framework in Z3 SMT solver.
